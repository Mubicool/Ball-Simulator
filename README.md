# Simulator
# Requires SFML library
This a simple ball bouncing simulator. It was made with only one purpose and that was to learn SFML. It is a very fun beginner coding project. It has edge detection and deflection. Use arrow keys to move the ball around. There are "cout"s to find the actual velocity of the ball in a free fall and the time taken for it to fall (In meters and seconds).You can mess around with the values such as ballSpeed, gravity and bounce fac etc (Try changing the max velocity to make the ball bounce indefinitely). If you haven't studied Object Oriented Programming (classes and objects), you can use the version previous to the OOP conversition and it will still work fine.
